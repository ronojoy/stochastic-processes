## Stochastic Processes

**Stochastic Processes in Physics, Chemistry and Biology** is an elective course for PhD coursework at [The Institute of Mathematical Sciences](www.imsc.res.in) and at the [Homi Bhabha National Institute](www.hbni.ac.in). The course was offered for the first time in Autumn 2007 and has been offered every alternate year since. 

The course is aimed to provide a broad, application-agnostic, introduction to stochastic methods in the physical sciences and in biology. The first part, covering approximately three-fourths of the course duration, will deal with the algebra of stochastic variables, the calculus of stochastic processes, Markov processes, the master equation with techniques of exact and approximate solutions, the diffusion approximation of the master equation, the related Fokker-Planck and Langevin descriptions, and end with stochastic field theories. Depending on feedback, applications in statistical mechanics, chemical kinetics, and population dynamics may be discussed. 

In the second part, an elementary introduction will be given to the Bayesian interpretation of probability, Bayesian inference, and the maximum entropy method. Depending on feedback, applications in data analysis, image restoration, and file compression may be given.
